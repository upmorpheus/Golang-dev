// StatelessLeafLinkCount is the value that should be assigned to
// fuse.Attr.Nlink for leaf nodes that don't track an explicit link
// count, such as files backed by the Content Addressable Storage (CAS).
//
// The Linux kernel doesn't treat fuse.Attr.Nlink as an opaque value.
// Its value gets stored in the kernel inode structure's i_nlink field.
// This cached value may later be incremented and decremented inside
// fuse_link() and fuse_unlink(), meaning that it may reach zero. Once
// zero, the kernel thinks the file is unlinked, causing future link()
// calls to fail.
//
// This means that the value of fuse.Attr.Nlink should ideally reflect
// the true number of paths under which these files are visible. For
// stateless files that is impossible to achieve, as they may appear in
// an arbitrary number of places that aren't known up front. Solve this
// by using a constant value that is sufficiently high for most use
// cases.
