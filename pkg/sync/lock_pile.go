// support recursion to be acquired multiple times. The underlying lock
// will only be unlocked if the recursion count reaches zero.
//
// LockPile implements a deadlock avoidance algorithm, ensuring that
// blocking on a lock is only performed when no other locks are held.
// What LockPile implements is equivalent to the "Smart" algorithm
// described on Howard Hinnant's page titled "Dining Philosophers
// Rebooted":
//
// https://howardhinnant.github.io/dining_philosophers.html
//
// As the set of locks held can be extended over time, there may be a
// possibility LockPile has to backtrack and temporarily unlock one or
// more locks it held prior to acquiring more. The caller is signalled
// when this happens, so that it may revalidate its state. Depending on
// the state's validity, the caller may either continue or retry.
