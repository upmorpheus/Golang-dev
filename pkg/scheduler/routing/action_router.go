// ActionRouter is responsible for doing all forms of analysis on an
// incoming execution request up to the point where InMemoryBuildQueue
// acquires locks and enqueues an operation. ActionRouter is responsible
// for the following things:
//
// - To extract a platform key from the action, so that
//   InMemoryBuildQueue knows on which workers the action needs to
//   execute.
// - To extract invocation keys from the client's context, so that
//   InMemoryBuildQueue can group operations belonging to the same
//   client and schedule them fairly with respect to other clients.
// - To create an initial size class selector, which InMemoryBuildQueue
//   can use to select the appropriate worker size.
