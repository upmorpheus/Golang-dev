// IsFaster returns a probability in range (0.0, 1.0) of the current set
// of outcomes being faster than another one. The algorithm for this is
// to compute the average rank in B for every element in A, similar to
// the Mann-Whitney U test. This is done for two reasons:
//
// - Analysis on mean or median values is not always possible, as a set
//   of outcomes may contain (or consist only of) failures of which the
//   execution time is unknown.
// - When implemented properly, it is an asymmetric relation, in that
//   x.IsFaster(x) == 0.5 and x.IsFaster(y) + y.IsFaster(x) == 1.0 for
//   any sets of outcomes x and y.
//
// This function works by running a 2-way merge algorithm against both
// sets of outcomes, awarding scores between [0, 2*len(B)] based on the
// rank in B for each of the elements in A, meaning a total score of
// 2*len(A)*len(B) may be earned. Inequality between elements always
// yields an even score. Odd scores may need to be given in case of
// identical values.
//
// To ensure that the probability returned by this function doesn't
// become too extreme for small sample counts, we add 1+len(B) to A's
// score, and 1+len(A) to B's score. This also makes sure that empty
// sets don't cause divisions by zero, and that the probability never
// becomes exactly 0.0 or 1.0. The latter is important for PageRank
// computation, as eigenvalue computation wouldn't converge otherwise.
// It also causes smaller sets to get an advantage, which is important
// for ensuring that all size classes are tested sufficiently. This is
// similar in spirit to the "plus four" rule for computing confidence
// intervals.
